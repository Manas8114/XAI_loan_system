Causal counterfactuals achieve the highest actionability score (0.167) 
and maintain perfect causal validity (100%), demonstrating 
that respecting causal dependencies produces more realistic and feasible recommendations.

DiCE and Optimization baselines show lower causal validity rates, indicating they 
may suggest changes that violate real-world constraints between features.
